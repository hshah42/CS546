            <p>A memorable time in Stevens was one where I was doing an assignment for my CS546 class. I had to make an html page form scratch. This was something I had done a lot of times. It always got my creative side out. Looking outside form my classroom I got this amazing view of the New York city skyline and I knew then and there that it inspired me to do this with all my heart. Not a lot of people go through what I did while doing this assignment. It was revolutionary for me.</p>
