            <p>Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark is the head of House Stark, whose members are involved in plot lines throughout most of the series. He and his wife, Catelyn Tully, have five children: Robb, the eldest, followed by Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon, the youngest. Ned's illegitimate son Jon Snow and his friend, Samwell Tarly, serve in the Night's Watch under Lord Commander Jeor Mormont. The Wildlings living north of the Wall include young Gilly, and warriors Tormund Giantsbane and Ygritte.</p>
            <p>Others associated with House Stark include Ned's ward Theon Greyjoy, his vassal Roose Bolton, and Bolton's bastard son, Ramsay Snow. Robb falls in love with the healer Talisa Maegyr, and Arya befriends the blacksmith's apprentice Gendry and the assassin Jaqen H'ghar. The tall warrior Brienne of Tarth serves Catelyn and, later, Sansa.</p>
